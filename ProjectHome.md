DHARMA is a tool used to create test cases for fuzzing of structured text inputs, such as markup and script. DHARMA takes a custom high-level grammar format as input, and produces random well-formed test cases as output. Some features:

  * Persistent variable tracking and cross-reference support
  * Intuitive cross-referencing and meta function syntax
  * Automatic leaf node bias after deep graph recursions
  * Internal constant overriding for greater configurability
  * Templated prefix and suffix outputs
